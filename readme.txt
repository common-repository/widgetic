Widgetic makes it easy to create beautiful widgets for your WordPress site.

== Description ==

*Adding widgets to your WordPress site should be easy. With this plugin, it finally is.*

Widgetic for WordPress provides you with a library of widgets you can use for your site, which can be customised using our `three steps Editor`. Not only can you change the look and feel of the widgets, but we also give you the ability to connect to different sources for your content.

What’s great is that we’re constantly adding new widgets to our library based on your feedback. So don’t hesitate to get in touch.

= What is Widgetic? =

Widgetic for WordPress is a plugin that connects your WordPress site to Widgetic, so you will need to have a Widgetic account first. Widgetic is a widget publishing tool that allows you to create customizable widgets using a simple WYSIWYG Editor. Widgetic is absolutely free for up to 5 widgets, with unlimited number of uses (for example you can create hundreds of widgets based on the Image Zoom Widget). Widgetic is a great choice if you want to engage your users.

If you do not have a Widgetic account, [create one here in 20 seconds](https://widgetic.com?ref=wp).


The widgets are hosted on our platform and we continuously improve them based on user feedback. To add a widget to your site, we use embed codes, just like YouTube.
